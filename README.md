## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned
Flexbox is useful when it comes to centring elements in the page, and I found setting min-height to 100vh is a game changer. It is also the first time that I used CSS variables so I'm very happy about that.


### Continued development
As a newbie newbie I was able to complete this challenge with the knowledge I have but to be honest I think my CSS needs to have a tidy up and be more organised.
